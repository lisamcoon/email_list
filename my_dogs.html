              Our first dog, Manny. He was pretty like a girl. You couldn't ask
              for a better first dog. He knew he was a dog, so he did dog things
              like lay at the foot of the bed, stick his head out the car
              window, and chase squirrels.

          <h3 id="Obie">Obie</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              After we lost Manny, we went to the Humane Society to get another
              dog. The dog I had my eye on wasn't going to work out. They said
              they had some beagle mixes. I did not want a beagle, but we took a
              look anyway. When we met Obie, my 6 year old son said "This is the
              right dog for us. This is the right dog for our family." And
              that's how Obie came to live with us. He did not do dog things
              because he knew he was a dog, he just was dog. Obie was 100%
              instinct.

          <h3 id="Lucy">Lucy</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              I decided I wanted to try having a puppy. I found Lucy on
              Craigslist from a family who bred their chocolate lab and pitbull.
              If I told you she was a lab, you'd totally believe me. We still
              had Obie when we got Lucy. Obie did not like Lucy, but Lucy loves
              other dogs, even though she gets attacked often by little dogs. I
              had no business getting a puppy. She's a good girl though. Just
              doesn't realize how big she is. I think she's brain damaged
              because Obie bit her in the head when she was a puppy.
